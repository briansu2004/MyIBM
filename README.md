## My IBM Projects

```text
When I worked for ..., I used many IBM products in many of my projects, including the following:
- IBM Integration Bus (IIB): I utilized IBM Integration Bus to design, develop, and deploy integration solutions that facilitate communication and data exchange between disparate systems. This involved configuring message flows, transforming data formats, and implementing message routing and mediation logic to enable seamless integration across heterogeneous environments.
- IBM MQ: I worked with IBM MQ to establish reliable and secure message queuing mechanisms for asynchronous communication between applications and systems. This included setting up queues, defining message formats, implementing message persistence and delivery guarantees, and managing message brokers to ensure the timely and reliable exchange of messages.
- Other IBM Products: In addition to IIB and MQ, I have also worked with other IBM products such as InfoSphere MDM (Master Data Management), WebSphere Application Server, IBM DB2, DataStage, QualityStage, and IBM Rational Application Developer (RAD). This comprehensive exposure to various IBM technologies has equipped me with a deep understanding of IBM's ecosystem and its capabilities across different domains and use cases.

### Project 33 - Refactored a commercial banking PaaS application for client National Bank of Canada

- Designed ETL tables in MS SQL Server based on the new business requirements
- Used Apex data loader to reconcile data to Salesforce Cloud.
- Improved the performance by tuning the whole CRM process and automation - monthly outage windows were shorted from 15 hours to 5 hours.
- Upgraded to real time data sync with IBM DataStage, IBM MDM REST web services and Salesforce bulk API to integrate data changes to Salesforce Cloud in Phase II - no more downtime eventually.

### Project 32 - Implemented an end-to-end Customer 360 project for client Manulife

- Built and deployed a Java application on WebSphere Application Server with Spring Data JPA to analyze the MDM log files and present the match and merge reports to the data stewards to review the data conflicts and manually merge them.
- Integrated data from 8 legacy applications with Informatica PowerCenter ETL.
- Improved data quality with IBM DataStage and QualityStage.
- Created golden data and managed reference data with IBM InfoSphere MDM.
- Led the change requests with detailed runbook.
- Used Dynamics 365 Custom WebAPI with Visual Studio to created REST web services for web and mobile apps; generated the client files with Swagger Editor.

### Project 31 - Implemented ETL solution with Informatica PowerCenter to migrate data from an old application on MS SQL Server to a new pharmacy application on DB2 for client Loblaw

- Documented the requirements and data lineages.
- Created source to target mappings.
- Defined the code convention and enforce parameter files.
- Used Oracle Developer to created new tables and views in the staging area.
- Designed the error handling mechanism.
- Set up the share folder and meta data in Repository Manager.
- Programmed complex PLSQL stored procedures to be the Post SQL scripts.
- Created mappings with various transformations in Mapping Designer.
- Added workflows for the mappings in Workflow Manager.
- Monitored the workflow executing in Workflow Monitor.
- Automated all workflows with CA AutoSys.
